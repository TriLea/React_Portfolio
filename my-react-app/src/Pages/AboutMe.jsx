            <p>Hi I'm Tristan, a cs drop out (finacial reasons) I took this class
                to distract my self from my mom's passing,
                <br />and I have seemingly made it a lot further than I thought I would;
                <br />
                thanks for teaching me fullstack coding
                UW bootcamp :D
                <br />
                I hope to find a job that will hellp me pay for my bachelors in cs!
